Keep asking questions.
Positive mood.
Say when you're not sure.


Don't give people crap advice...
Can look it up. 





Script:

Looks like we're trying to do X.
I'm not sure how to proceed.

I'd like to go look at my own repo and figure out how I did this stuff when I was a student. Can I follow up in 10-15 minutes?

Sweet.
Shoot me a DM if you guys figure it out. 

If we can't figure it out then, I'll see if there's a tech mentor that can help.

Nice!
